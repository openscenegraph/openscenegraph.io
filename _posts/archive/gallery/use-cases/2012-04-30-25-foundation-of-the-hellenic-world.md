### **More information**


[The Foundations](http://www.fhw.gr/) mission is the preservation and dissemination of Hellenic history and tradition, the creation of an awareness of the universal dimension of Hellenism and the promotion of its contribution to cultural evolution. Its aim is the understanding of the past as a point of reference for the formation of the present and future so that contemporary thought may once again be inspired by the Hellenic spirit. In order to achieve this mission, the Foundation is actively involved with the dissemination of Hellenic culture and history, placing particular emphasis to Hellenism all over the world. To achieve this mission the Hellenic Cosmos Cultural Center was created.  
   
 The [Hellenic Cosmos cultural centre](http://www.hellenic-cosmos.gr/) of the Foundation of the Hellenic World (FHW), at 254 Pireos street, is one of the most perfect museum areas of Athens. It lies on a former industrial ribbon development in an area of approximately 60,000m2, on an axis between Athens and Piraeus, where memory of Athens past meets the city's modern identity. It is an ultra modern, living museum of Hellenism, across the sciences, arts and every aspect of society: it aims to be a source of information that satisfies the needs of contemporary 'society of knowledge".   
   
 The innovative technology of Virtual Reality is used by the Foundation of the Hellenic World for the promotion of Hellenic history and culture. In the systems that are installed at Hellenic Cosmos visitors of all ages, with special stereoscopic glasses travel through time, to monuments and sites of our cultural heritage, and have the experience of being immersed in the Virtual world.  
 The [VR system](http://vr.hellenic-cosmos.gr/) that are currenlty open to the public are:


1) The "Tholos", a 132 seat DOME Stereo projection system with optical tracking, where each seat is equiped with buttons and joystick controller for user interaction. [http://www.tholos254.gr](http://www.tholos254.gr/)
