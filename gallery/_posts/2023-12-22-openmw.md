OpenMW is a Free and Open Source reimplementation of the engine of the hit 2002 role playing game *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*.
As well as aiming to support all features of the original engine (and eventually all its successors), OpenMW boasts a range of graphical improvements, including more modern shader effects, massive viewing distances, improved shadows and lighting, and a flexible post processing framework.

In addition to all this, OpenMW includes an editor for game mods, or even entirely new games free from any IP restrictions, such as the OpenMW Example Suite.

The project's website is [openmw.org](https://openmw.org/), and development happens on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw).

A third-party project to port OpenMW to the VulkanSceneGraph is underway [here](https://github.com/vsgopenmw-dev/vsgopenmw).
